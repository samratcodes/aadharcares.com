## 🧠 How AI Enhances the Platform

We use **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, a powerful LLM, to interpret users’ latest health reports and generate human-readable health summaries like:

> _“Your heart rate is slightly elevated compared to the normal range. Consider managing stress and staying hydrated.”_

This turns raw numbers into **insightful narratives** for proactive health decisions.
